# task-3
This project is Task 3 assigned during the internship at Skillcraft Technology. It demonstrates how to build and evaluate a Decision Tree Classifier using Python and scikit-learn. The notebook walks through the full process of data handling, training, and evaluating a classification model.

## Description

The objective of this task was to implement a decision tree algorithm from scratch or using libraries, train it on a dataset, and analyze its performance. The Jupyter Notebook contains step-by-step code and explanations suitable for beginners in machine learning.

## How to Run

Open `decision-tree.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook or a compatible editor and execute the cells in sequence to follow along with the model development process.
